## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Project plan, team charter, risk register and definition of done.
- UX, engineering and operations guides: information architecture, UI guidelines, tech
  stack, repository structure, coding standards, testing strategy, local development,
  deployment, observability and runbook.
- AI specification: matching engine, per role AI features, evaluation protocol, dataset
  collection guide and model lifecycle, plus the seed and dataset contracts in `data/`.
- Architecture overview, data model, REST API catalog, security and privacy design, and
  ten architecture decision records.
- Software requirements specification with business rules, state machines, permission
  matrix, notification catalog and traceability matrix.
- Product requirements, user stories, success metrics and glossary.
- Repository skeleton for `api/`, `web/`, `ml/` and `deploy/`, contribution guide, security
  policy, issue and pull request templates.
- Shared synthetic data fixtures for matching fusion, privacy masking, and fuzzy name
  matching, including a validator used before service contract tests consume them.
- Added deterministic synthetic image fixtures for colour, EXIF, OCR, and masking tests.
- Added a CI check that detects drift in reviewed fixture image bytes with SHA-256 hashes.
- Added an intake privacy regression test using the shared synthetic GPS fixture.
- Added a checker for blank full and trial evaluation-template scaffolds before collection.
- Clarified the root status so it reflects the implemented data foundation without implying
  that the other services have started.
- Added a dedicated data CI workflow for seed, fixture, and data-script validation.
- Added a safe freeze step that publishes only a validated private evaluation manifest.
- Added an auditable raw-response option for the OpenStreetMap location review flow.
- Added a provenance check that catches drift between raw location data and its review CSV.
- Added bounded retry handling for transient OpenStreetMap extraction failures.
- Ensured location-review extraction excludes candidates outside the requested bbox.
- Improved OpenStreetMap location-kind classification for public amenities and institutions.
- Added a private counts-only summary for planning the manual location review.
- Added private dataset gates for the 1080 px image short-side minimum and exact duplicate
  image content.
- Added a cross-item perceptual-hash gate for visually near-identical private images.
- Hardened evaluation split verification against edits that change stratum allocation.
- Added a private two-annotator label agreement checker with aggregate Cohen's kappa.
- Hardened reviewed-location promotion against empty output and invalid OSM provenance.
- Added a blank trial exit-review log template for the private collection workflow.
- Added an atomic generator for the private trial-review workspace and annotation sheets.
- Added a final private trial-review gate for completed collection records.
- Bound trial completion to a current agreement report generated from both annotation sheets.
- Added a read-only private evaluation freeze gate that aggregates the required checks.
- Stabilized synthetic fixture image CI validation with reviewed SHA-256 integrity hashes.
- Added an explicit campus-bbox check for complete location seeds.
- Made evaluation image intake convert accepted inputs to canonical JPEG files.
- Added a safe local evaluation fetcher that verifies manifest-listed files before copying
  them from a private dataset sync or mount.
- Prevented manifest publication and evaluation fetch output from being written inside a
  private source dataset directory.
- Made seed foundation checks reject partial deferred seed files before complete-mode
  validation is explicitly requested.
- Made manifest publication print the dataset SHA-256 for reproducible handoff records.
- Hardened private manifest checks against symlink dataset roots and manifest files.
- Hardened seed validation against symlink roots and files outside the checkout.
- Required location promotion to recheck provenance against the saved raw Overpass response.
- Made negative campus-bbox examples portable across supported Python CLI parsers by
  using the `--bbox=...` form in tests and handoff documentation.
- Rejected manifest-listed paths that traverse symlinked directories, keeping private
  dataset validation inside the dataset root.
- Applied symlink-parent checks to private dataset intake, fetch, and manifest
  publication before any source or output path is resolved.
- Extended symlink-parent checks to private template/workspace generation and their
  validators, keeping all collection roots tied to the requested directory.
- Tightened category-seed validation for empty trees, field types, prompt/question text,
  and optional positive retention overrides.
- Rejected normalized collisions between brand names/aliases and between synonym terms,
  preventing ambiguous master-data lookups.
- Extended output parent-path safety to OSM review artifacts, location promotion, private
  summaries/reports, evaluation splits, and fixture regeneration.
- Hardened settings domain validation and complete-seed location aliases against invalid,
  blank, or normalized duplicate lookup values.
- Hardened complete post and model-version validation against blank contact values,
  overlapping hours, and malformed component/status types.
